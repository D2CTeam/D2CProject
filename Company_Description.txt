GitHub really only tracks changes in text files. Trying to see if we can force it to work with a word document. 

Also should start using GitHub to track changes.  It’s probably a good idea to get familiar with this.
Wonder if we can meet for 30 minutes or so to kind of layout initial workflow/screens and divide up – that way we can each begin designing a screen 
interface in SceneBuilder or using javaFX? 

2nd page is kind of an overview brainstorm of the various parts. We don’t have to implement all of them we can start small and add on as time permits.
3rd page is a start on outlining classes
We could aim for this to be an online app where the customer creates an account and can fill out a request for service online.

1.	Customer opens service request In the desktop version this would be initiated by a phone call or an email – so an office worker would be completing the 
information in the desktop application.
a.	They either already have an account, or create one  Would need to have a screen to search for a name in the customer database and then display the info,
 or add a new customer to the database (with all the info filled in)
2.	Customer fills in service request, includes tasks and date they want it done  Desktop version the office worker would complete an initial service request form
3.	Estimate is completed by office (hourly rate, amount per service)
4.	Estimate is accepted by customer
5.	Job is confirmed by office
6.	Job is scheduled  includes:
a.	Scheduling employees for specific tasks
b.	Scheduling equipment (truck, mowers, etc.)
c.	Ordering inventory if needed
7.	Job takes place, employees complete job form with timesheets
8.	Customer signs off on job
9.	Customer is invoiced
10.	Payment is received
